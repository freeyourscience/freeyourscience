      The automatic re-publication process below is powered by ShareYourPaper from our
      friends over at the non-profit OA.works, who share our values and mission.
      If everything is fine with the document you deposit below, it will be re-published
      to zenodo.org straight away and we will show you a link to your new open access
      version.
      If we have reason to double check your upload, we will do so as fast as we can and
      send you an email after we have done so.
