    <h1>How to re-publish?</h1>
    <p>
        We provide you with six relevant steps and the matching entrypoints for the most
        common open access re-publication workflows.
    </p>

    </ol>
    <h2 id="version">1. Find the correct version of your manuscript</h2>
    <p>
        The pathway we find for your article will specify which version of the manuscript you are allowed to re-publish.
        The specified version will be one of three manuscript states.
    </p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Published version</dt>
        <dd>
            Version of a manuscript published by e.g. a journal.
            This is usually a PDF file that has the journals logo and copyright notice on it and is typeset to the
            style of the journal.
        </dd>
        <dt>Accepted version</dt>
        <dd>
            Final version of the manuscript sent by the author(s) to the publisher.
            This is the result of the peer review process and includes changes and corrections by the author(s), but
            not the copy-editing and typesetting done by the publisher.
            Content should be the same as the published version, but appearance might differ strongly.
        </dd>
        <dt>Submitted version</dt>
        <dd>
            What was initially submitted for peer review.
            Content might differ strongly from the accepted version.
        </dd>
    </dl>
    <p>
        The University of Cambridge Office of Scholarly Communication has a <a href="https://unlockingresearch-blog.lib.cam.ac.uk/?p=1872">blog post with more in depth explanations</a>.
    </p>
    <small>
        We always display the pathway that allows the most mature version of the manuscript to be re-published.
        If you no longer have the version specified by the pathway you might also be allowed to re-publish an earlier one.
        Check the pathway details in the Sherpa policy database for what other versions are allowed.
        You will find a <em>Visit this policy</em> link in the pathway result that takes you there.
    </small>

    <h2 id="prerequisites">2. Check the conditions</h2>
    <p>
        The pathways we get from the Sherpa Romeo policy database can have three types of conditions.
        Before you re-publish you need to ensure that these are met.
    </p>
    <p>
        The pathways we show might only have a subset of these conditions or none at all.
    </p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Embargos</dt>
        <dd>
            An embargo means you have to wait a specified time after the publisher published your manuscript before you are allowed to re-publish it.
            You will have to check the date of publication and then do the math.
        </dd>
        <dt>Content related</dt>
        <dd>
            Some pathways only allow re-publishing of manuscripts from certain subject areas.
            Others explicitly require the manuscript to be a research article.
        </dd>
        <dt>External conditions</dt>
        <dd>
            Re-publication might also only be allowed if your institution or funder require it.
            Some countries might also require re-publication by law and the pathway can specify this as a condition.
            Pathways can also only be applicable to work funded by specific publishers.
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <h2 id="repository">3. Choose an appropriate repository</h2>
    <p>
        The pathway may allow you to re-publish your work in a variety of places.
        How do you find and choose the best place?
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>prefer public repositories over websites or social networks</li>
        <li>use places <a href="https://unpaywall.org/sources">indexed by Unpaywall</a></li>
        <li>find suitable repositories with <a href="https://v2.sherpa.ac.uk/opendoar/index.html">OpenDOAR</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This will ensure your work is easily findable and available to the widest possible audience.
    </p>

    <h2 id="coauthors">4. Check with your co-authors</h2>
    <p>
        Copyright and co-authorship can be a complex topic and we are in no position to provide legal advice.
        That being said, we'd suggest you only re-publish with the consent of your co-authors.
    </p>

    <h2 id="upload">5. Upload to repository</h2>
    <p>
        This step will be specific to your choosen repository.
        If you have trouble with this step, your institution's librarians are probably able to help you.
    </p>
    <h2 id="linkback">6. Link back to the paywalled version</h2>
    <p>
        To ensure compliance with the publisher's policy and to make sure your
        readers cite the correct version, make sure that the re-published version
        links to the main, paywalled publication.
    </p>
    <p>
        This might mean adding a note like
        "Published in Dragon Paywall Journal 10.200/123.123"
        when uploading to the repository.
    </p>
    <p>
        The exact method might be specified by the repository (e.g. <a href="https://arxiv.org/help/jref">arXiv specific guide</a>).
        The pathway might also note that the publisher requires the note to follow a certain pattern.
