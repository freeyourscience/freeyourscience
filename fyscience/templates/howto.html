    <h1>How to re-publish?</h1>
    <p>
        We provide you with six relevant steps and the matching entrypoints for the most
        common open access re-publication workflows.
    </p>

    <h2 id="version">1. Find the correct version of your manuscript</h2>
    <p>
        The pathway we find for your publication will specify which version of the manuscript you are allowed to
        re-publish.
        The specified version will be one of following three.
    </p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Published version</dt>
        <dd>
            Version of a manuscript published by e.g. a journal.
            This is usually a PDF file that has the journals logo and copyright notice on it and is typeset to the
            style of the journal.
        </dd>
        <dt>Accepted version</dt>
        <dd>
            Final version of the manuscript sent by the author(s) to the publisher.
            This is the result of the peer review process and includes changes and corrections by the author(s), but
            not the copy-editing and typesetting done by the publisher.
            Content should be the same as the published version, but appearance might differ strongly.
        </dd>
        <dt>Submitted version</dt>
        <dd>
            What was initially submitted for peer review.
            Content might differ strongly from the accepted version.
        </dd>
    </dl>
    <p>
        The University of Cambridge Office of Scholarly Communication has a <a
            href="https://unlockingresearch-blog.lib.cam.ac.uk/?p=1872">blog post with more in depth explanations</a>.
    </p>
    <small>
        We always display the pathway that allows the most mature version of the manuscript to be re-published.
        If you no longer have the version specified by the pathway you might also be allowed to re-publish an earlier
        one.
        Check the pathway details in the Sherpa Romeo policy database for what other versions are allowed.
        You will find a <em>Visit this policy</em> link in the pathway result that takes you there.
    </small>

    <h2 id="conditions">2. Check the conditions</h2>
    <p>
        The pathways we get from the Sherpa Romeo policy database can have three types of conditions.
        Before you re-publish you need to ensure that these are met.
        If there are none, you are good to go.
    </p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Embargos</dt>
        <dd>
            An embargo means you have to wait a specified time after the publisher published your manuscript before you
            are allowed to re-publish it.
            You will have to check the date of publication and then do the math.
        </dd>
        <dt>Content related</dt>
        <dd>
            Some pathways only allow re-publishing of manuscripts from certain subject areas.
            Others explicitly require the manuscript to be a research article.
        </dd>
        <dt>External conditions</dt>
        <dd>
            Re-publication might also only be allowed if your institution or funder require it.
            Some countries might also require re-publication by law and the pathway can specify this as a condition.
            Pathways can also only be applicable to work funded by specific publishers.
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <h2 id="where">3. Choose where to upload</h2>
    <p>
        The pathway may allow you to upload your work in a variety of places.
        Our recommendation for choosing is:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>prefer public repositories over websites or social networks</li>
        <li>use places <a href="https://unpaywall.org/sources">indexed by Unpaywall</a></li>
        <li>find suitable repositories with <a href="https://v2.sherpa.ac.uk/opendoar/index.html">OpenDOAR</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        A repository is very much like a digital library.
        Technically, it is any place where you can store digital assets that is usually indexed by search engines.
        This will ensure your work is easily findable and available to the widest possible audience.
    </p>

    <h2 id="coauthors">4. Check with your co-authors</h2>
    <p>
        We'd suggest you only re-publish with the consent of your co-authors.
        That being said, copyright and co-authorship can be a complex topic and we are in no position to provide legal
        advice.
    </p>

    <h2 id="upload">5. Upload to selected repository</h2>
    <p>
        This step will be specific to your choosen repository.
        If you have trouble with this step, your institution's librarians are likely able to help you.
    </p>

    <h2 id="linkback">6. Link back to the initial publication</h2>
    <p>
        Most publisher's policies require that the re-published version links back to the initial, paywalled
        publication.
        If this is the case, make sure to follow their guidelines.
        This also helps your readers cite the appropriate publication.
    </p>
    <p>
        This might mean adding a note like
        "Published in Dragon Paywall Journal 10.200/123.123"
        when uploading to the repository.
    </p>
    <p>
        The exact method might be specified by the repository (e.g. <a href="https://arxiv.org/help/jref">arXiv specific
            guide</a>).
        The publisher policy might also require the note to follow a certain pattern.
