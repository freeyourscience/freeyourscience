    <h1>How to re-publish?</h1>

        We provide you with six relevant steps and the matching entrypoints for the most
        common open access re-publication workflows.

    <h2 id="version">1. Find the correct version of your manuscript</h2>
    <h3>Published version</h3>
    <p>
        Version of a manuscript published by e.g. a journal.
        This is usually a PDF file that has the journals logo and copyright notice on it
        and is typeset to the style
        of the journal.
    </p>
    <h3>Accepted version</h3>
    <p>
        Final version of the manuscript sent by the author(s) to the publisher.
        This is the result of the peer review process and includes changes and
        corrections by the author(s), but not the copy-editing and typesetting done by
        the publisher.
        Content should be the same as the published version, but appearance might differ
        strongly.
    </p>
    <h3>Submitted version</h3>
    <p>
        What was initially submitted for peer review.
        Content might differ strongly from the accepted version.
    </p>

        Communication.
    </p>
    <small>
        We always propose the most mature version of the manuscript, in case you can not
        find the one we propose but an earlier one, double check the pathway details in
        the Sherpa policy database for what other versions are allowed.

    <h2 id="repository">3. Choose an appropriate repository</h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2 id="coauthors">4. Check with your co-authors</h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2 id="upload">5. Upload to repository</h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2 id="linkback">6. Link back to the paywalled version</h2>
    <p>
        To ensure compliance with the publisher's policy and to make sure your readers
        cite the correct version, make sure that the re-published version links to the
        main, paywalled publication.
        This can be achieved by adding a note like "Published in Dragon Paywall Journal
        doi: 10.200/123.123" to the page header in the open access version.
