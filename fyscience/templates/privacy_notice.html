        <h1>Privacy Notice</h1>
        <p>
            To understand how Free Your Science is used, identify bugs and improve the site we use data from two sources:
            The logs of the application itself and website analytics generated using Matomo.
        </p>
        <p>
            To the best of our knowledge none of the data we collect is personal data i.e. can be tied back to you.
            Nevertheless we want to share our approach with you.
            If you have any questions or suggestions, please reach out to us.
        </p>

        <h2>Application Logs</h2>
        <p>
            Our application logs contain:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>entered search terms</li>
            <li>results we found</li>
            <li>pages loaded</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Website Analytics</h2>
        <p>
            We host an instance of <a href="https://matomo.org">Matomo</a> ourselves.
            Each time you load a page this records:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>which page has been visited</li>
            <li>how much time was spent on it</li>
            <li>which links where clicked</li>
            <li>how long the page took to load</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We do this to try and understand which areas of Free Your Science are of interest to people and how people navigate the page.
            We use this information to find ways of improving Free Your Science for its users.
        </p>
        <p>
            To protect your privacy we take the following steps to prevent us or anyone else from tying the data back to you as an individual:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>no use of cookies</li>
            <li>IP addresses are anonymized</li>
            <li>no data is recorded if browser sends a <a href="https://www.eff.org/de/issues/do-not-track">Do Not Track</a></li>
            <li>the data is only accesible to Daniel and Lukas</li>
        </ul>
